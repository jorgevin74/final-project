# MEDP33100 - Final Project, Public Archive

## Live Demo

https://final-project-065a.onrender.com

## Project Overview

This is a website that allows users to look up their favorite (or non-favorite) albums and lets users allow them to grade them on a scale from 1 - 10 and give a small piece of text window to type their review

Once you click on post, then you’ll be able to add the review on the web page 

## Endpoints

We reach the first endpoint with the spotify where are able to access and recieve all of the albums, then we use the search to be able to get the albums that we want or rather that the user wants to be able to pop up onto the website. Then we go into the MongoDB to store all of the information and then extract that information and put it into our website

## Future Enhancements

I think I would definitely work on the responsiveness a bit more, as well just tuning and fixing up quality of life code inside of the files.

Also fixing up some areas that there wasn’t no time 
to fix such as the post area where you are writing a review I think that could be improved but for now I am happy to get this pushed out
